They are often reproduced using photocopiers and circulated as physical publications, though many are also created and shared digitally.   Need inspiration? Each session, we will provide an optional prompt to spark creativity and free zine making kits while supplies last. With your permission, zines made at this event may be scanned, printed, folded, and shared.   We will meet in C-220 on February 18, March 4 & 25, and April 8 from 6 pm - 8 pm.
